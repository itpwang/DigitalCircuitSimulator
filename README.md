DigitalCircuitSimulator
=======================

Digital Circuit Simulator in Python

This repository contains an initial data model and helper functions which can be used to wire up pins/gates (AND, OR, NOT).
File edited in class.

Will contain additional gates as class progresses (XOR, XAND, NOR, NAND).
Will also accommodate for further needs as class progresses.
